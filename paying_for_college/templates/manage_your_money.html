        <span class="btn-close">&times;</span>
        <p>Your financial aid disbursement is the money left after your school takes out the cost of tuition, fees, and any on-campus living expenses from your total financial aid award. You normally have several options for how you get that money, including direct deposit to a bank account, to a card that might also double as your student ID, by check, or cash.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="bubble-transparent-answer font-s">
        <span class="btn-close">&times;</span>
        <p>When you spend more money than you have in your account, your bank will likely charge you an overdraft fee. So a $4 cup of coffee can end up costing you $35 or more. You can be charged several overdraft fees in a single day and even more in extended overdraft charges if your account remains overdrawn for a few days, so be careful - these fees add up quickly.
</p>
<p>To avoid paying overdraft fees, monitor your accounts carefully and consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not opting-in to services that pay for overdrafts connected to ATM or one-time debit card withdrawals</li>
<li>Linking your account to a savings account - you may still pay a fee for transferring funds from your savings account, but it is usually much lower than an overdraft fee</li>
<li>Choosing an account that does not allow overdrafts</li></ul>
