### Installation
This project is not fully functional, but feel free to give it a spin. Here's how:
- Install the setup dependencies if you don't have them.
- Go to the local directory where you want the project to be created, make a virtual environment, clone this repository (or your own fork of it).
```bash
mkvirtualenv college-costs
git clone https://github.com/cfpb/college-costs.git .
setvirtualenvproject
```
- Set up front-end resources and database assets:
```bash
./local_setup.sh

### Prepping solr
- If you want the college-search function to work (you know you do), you'll need to prep and fire up solr.  
Adust the `build_solr_schema` command to match your local installation of solr and your solr version number.   
The example is for a brew-installed solr, with brew using the user's home director as its Cellar site and solr version 4.10.2.  
Be sure you're in the projects root directory, `/college-costs/`:  
```bash
./manage.py build_solr_schema > ~/homebrew/Cellar/solr/4.10.2/example/schema.xml
```

- Open new terminal window or tab for running the solr process.
If you installed with homebrew, you can adjust the following command to match your Cellar location and solr version:
```bash
cd /[PATH TO HOMEBREW]/homebrew/Cellar/solr/4.10.2/example/ && java -jar start.jar
```
That launches the solr process, so leave it running in that terminal window/tab and return to your first window/tab.  
The last step is to rebuild the solr index:
```
./manage.py rebuild_index --noinput
```

- Finally, fire up a local web server:
```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

The college-cost tools should show up at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/paying-for-college/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/paying-for-college/)

The app is set up to run as a component of CFPB's website, [consumerfinance.gov](http://www.consumerfinance.gov), so if you run it locally, some fonts and font-related icons may not load because of [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) policies.


### Running tests
You can run python tests from the project root with this command:
```bash
./pytest.sh
```

<!-- INCLUDE IN setup.sh
- Build the front-end requirements and the JavaScript files.

```bash
npm install
grunt Build
```
